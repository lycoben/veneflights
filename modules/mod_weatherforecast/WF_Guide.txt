###################################################

HOW TO .... 
Installation/Customisation

###########################
       INSTALLATION:
###########################

1.  Install as a module in the back end of your Joomla! site.
2.  Publish the module in your prefered position.
3.  Find your prefered weatherstation at www.wunderground.com and copy the complete URL.
4.  Customise your module following the instruction below.

    Note:  In future versions customisation will be possible through the module 
    parameters but currently they do not work as well as editing the files
    themselves.  

***************************
        ATTENTION:
***************************

To reduce the data flow to the Wunderground servers, this module locally caches the
forecast information for 30 minutes to the following file in your root directory:

mod_weatherforecast.txt

When you change your location or language you therefore have to delete this file, 
or wait for 30 minutes to see the changes.

###########################
       TO CUSTOMISE:
###########################

>>> Preface:

The 5-day forecast at the following site is a good example of how Wunderground's
data can be made to look good - these qualities should be able to be achieved in 
future versions of this module:

http://www.wunderground.com/global/stations/03022.html

###########################
          TO DO:
###########################

1.  Make all of the above customisable through the module's parameters.  
2.  Make it possible to use your own icon set.
3.  Make it easy to change:

    - day title font color
    - day title background
    - forecast table cell background
    - table borders and padding

 MESSAGE FROM THE AUTHOR:
##########################

Thank you for your interest in this module.

By following the customisation tips above you can get the weather for 
nearly every city in the world. For stations in the United States, US 
Territories or Canada however you will receive an error message. 

The copyright policy of Wunderground states that in order to use this 
script you need to:

1. Have your weather station submit data to WeatherUnderground as a WU member.
   (If you operate a weather station).  

2. Use this script ONLY on your personal, non-commercial weather station 
   website.

3. Leave attribution (and hotlinks) to WeatherUnderground as the source 
   of the data.

If you adhere to these three requirements, you should have fair use of 
the data provided by www.wunderground.com.
